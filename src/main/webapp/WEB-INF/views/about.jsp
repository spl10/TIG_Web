<p id="font-default">
There are several reasons behind starting an Indian Grocery shops. As everyone could guess, 
Indian Culture follows a unique kind of tradition where we used to cook and serve Indian foods 
during festivals and ceremony. As most of the Indians, we do follow traditions in a conservative 
way and we suffered a lot to get Indian groceries for the ceremonies at our home in Germany.  
Our main aim is to make Indian Groceries available to the communities in and around Munich with 
an ease of reachability.

<p id="font-default">
We are planning to provide the items at a price with marginal profit and we are building a 
website to take orders online and free delivery for orders more than a specific amount. 
Another biggest benefit is the location. Since, the shop is in the U6 line, in which we 
have two big dorms at Studentenstadt and Klinikum Groﬂhadern where most of the Indian students 
are studying from Universities in and around Munich. In addition, this U6 line also connects directly 
to Universit‰t and Garching campuses. This eases the commutation to our shop.
